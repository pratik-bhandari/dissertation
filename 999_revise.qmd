Some text.

$A = \argmax_a f(a)$

```{=tex}
\begin{align} \label{eq:noisy-channel2}
\hat{m_p} &= \argmax_{m_p} P(m_p | u_p, N)\\ \label{eq:eq:noisy-channel3}
\hat{m_p} &= \argmax_{m_p} P(m_p | u_p) * P(u_p|u_i, N) * P(u_i | m_i) * P(m_i)
\end{align}

It shows:
    -   the probability of inferring a meaning $m_p$ from a perceived utterance $u_p$ ($P(m_p | u_p)$)
    -   bottom-up auditory information, i.e., the probability of a listener hearing a particular utterance $u_p$ given that a speaker has uttered an utterance $u_i$ in a noisy channel $N$ ($P(u_p|u_i, N)$)
  - utterance encoding, i.e., the likelihood of an utterance/signal given a message from the speaker ($P(u_i|m_i)$)
    -   the probability of the message $m_i$ being sent by a speaker ($P(m_i)$)
    -   prior information (e.g., top-down semantic knowledge), i.e., the joint probability of an utterance $u_i$ and its intended meaning by a speaker $m_i$ ($P(u_i,m_i)$)
