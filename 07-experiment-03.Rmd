# Experiment 3: Comprehension of degraded speech is modulated by the rate of speech

\minitoc

## Introduction

Language comprehension depends on the features and quality of speech signal
which is hampered in adverse listening conditions when speech is distorted, for example, due to change in rate of speech, and spectral degradation of speech.
Studies have shown that individuals can benefit from sentence context to compensate for distorted speech, at least when the level of speech degradation is at an intermediate level [e.g., @Bhandari2021; @Obleser2010], and at varying speech rate [@Aydelott2004; cf. @Goy2013].
The goal of the present study is to examine if sentence context can provide benefit when speech that is degraded at an intermediate level is presented at different rates (from slow, normal, and fast); speech in day-to-day conversation is distorted and presents itself at varying rate [e.g., @Krause2004].
In the following, we first summarize the impact of speech degradation in language comprehension, and its interaction with sentence context, and then the influence of speech rate on language comprehension, and its interaction with sentence context.

### Comprehension of degraded speech 

There are a number of studies showing that speech intelligibility and language comprehension is hampered when the bottom-up input is less intelligible due to spectral degradation of the speech signal [@Shannon1995; @Davis2005].
These studies have used noise vocoding as a methods of speech degradation. Here the speech signal is first divided into a specific number of frequency bands that corresponds to the number of vocoder channels.
The amplitude envelope within each frequency band is extracted, and the spectral information within it is replaced by noise.
The resulting vocoded speech contains temporal cues of the original speech, but it is difficult to understand – the lesser the number of vocoder channels, the lesser is the intelligibility.
More attentional resources are required to process and comprehend such degraded speech as compared to clean speech [e.g., @Eckert2016; @Wild2012].

Listeners rely more on top-down predictions when the speech signal is less intelligible due to spectral degradation.
Hence, they use the context information of the sentence to narrow down their predictions to a smaller set of semantic categories or words [@Strauss2013; see also, @Corps2020].
However, it is important that the context itself is ‘intelligible enough’ which is the case when the speech is only moderately degraded.
For example, Obleser and colleagues [@Obleser2007; @Obleser2010; @Obleser2011] found that at moderate levels of speech degradation, target words (the sentence final words) were better recognized when it was predictable from the sentence context than when it was unpredictable.
When the speech signal is clear or only very mildly degraded, there is typically no effect of predictability on comprehension, as even unpredictable words can be understood well in this condition (intelligibility is at ceiling).
In contrast, when the speech signal is extremely degraded (for instance at 1 channel noise vocoding), no facilitation from the context can be observed as the context itself cannot be understood and hence it cannot help with comprehension [@Bhandari2021; @Obleser2007; @Obleser2010; @Obleser2011].

These studies also found that semantic predictability facilitated comprehension of degraded speech at a moderate level of spectral degradation, i.e., at 4 channels noise vocoding.
At the moderate degradation level, most speech is intelligible enough for listeners to understand and form meaning representation of the context to generate predictions about upcoming word in the sentence.
In sum, xxxx

### Comprehension of fast and slow speech

A change in speech rate manipulates the speech signal without producing any spectral degradation.
Compared to normal and slow speech, understanding fast speech is more effortful (e.g., Müller et al., 2019; Winn & Teece, 2021; see also, Simantiraki & Cooke, 2019, 2020), with reduced intelligibility and comprehension (Fairbanks & Kodman Jr., 1957; Garvey, 1953; Goldstein, 1941; Konkle et al., 1977; Liu & Zeng, 2006; Peelle & Wingfield, 2005; Schlueter et al., 2014).
The comprehension deficit in fast speech has been linked to speed of processing (Gordon-Salant & Fitzgibbons, 1995; Tun, 1998; see also, Rönnberg et al., 2013).
Decoding speech signal and processing language does not occur in vacuum; they take place within the limited cognitive resources and memory that we have (Riggs et al., 1993).
When the speech rate is fast, the flow of information is also fast. There is a limited time available to decode and understand the information in the fast speech.
Decoding and identification of incoming information in the fast speech puts a high demand on available cognitive resources (e.g., Rodero, 2016).
Processing rapidly flowing information exhausts the cognitive resource that is required for language processing (Gordon-Salant & Fitzgibbons, 2004; Janse, 2009).
Hence, intelligibility and comprehension of fast speech is reduced compared to normal speech.

In contrast, the evidence on the effect of decrease in speech rate on intelligibility and language comprehension is mixed.
@Shobha2009 showed that expansion of speech signal benefits word recognition in noise at different signal to noise ratio (SNR) ranging from 6dB SNR to 12 dB SNR.
In a sample of younger adults and middle aged adults, slowing down the speech rate facilitated word recognition when listeners had to segregate the speech from background talkers, i.e., in speech masking [@Brungart2007].
<!-- However, when noise masking is presented, reduced speech rate did not help in understanding speech. -->

### Predictive processing, degraded speech, and different rates of presentation of peech

### Current study 

## Methods

### Participants

We recruited two groups of participants via Prolific Academic and assigned them to one of the two groups:
*fast speech group* (n=101; $\bar{x}$  $\pm$ SD = 23.14 $\pm$ XX years; age range = 18-31 years; 66 females, 1 preferred not to say) and *slow speech group* (n=101; $\pm$ SD = 23.6 $\pm$ 3.2 years; age range = 18-30 years; 14 females).
All participants were native speakers of German residing in Germany.
Exclusion criteria for participating in this study were self-reported hearing disorder, speech-language disorder, or any neurological disorder.
All participants received monetary compensation for their participation.
The German Society for Language Science ethics committee approved the study and participants provided an informed consent in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki.

### Materials

We used the stimuli created by the method described in Section X.X.X in Chapter X.X which consisted of 360 German sentences spoken by a female native German speaker in an unaccented normal rate of speech.
Two categories of sentences that differed in the cloze probability of the target words (nouns) appearing the final word of the sentence were created from 120 nouns.
Thus, we compared high and low predictability sentences (abbreviated as HP and LP henceforth) which were sentences with low and high cloze target words respectively.
This gave 240 sentences that consisted of pronoun, verb, determiner, and object (noun).
The mean cloze probabilities of target words for low and high predictability sentences were 0.022 $\pm$ 0.027 ($\bar{x}$  $\pm$ SD; range = 0.00 - 0.09) and 0.752 $\pm$ 0.123 ($\bar{x}$  $\pm$ SD; range = 0.56 - 1.00) respectively.

These 240 sentences were passed compressed by a factor of 0.65, and expanded by a factor of 1.35 using PSOLA built-in in Praat to create fast and slow speech respectively.
Speech degradation of all normal, slow and fast speech was achieved by noise vocoding through 4 channels.

In both the groups, fast speech group and slow speech group, each participant was presented with 120 unique sentences: 60 HP and 60 LP sentences.
Speech rate was also balanced across each predictability level.
The fast speech group received 30 sentences with normal speed and 30 with fast speed in each of the predictability conditions.
Similarly, the slow speech group received 30 sentences with normal speed and 30 with slow speed in each of the predictability conditions.
This resulted into 4 experimenal lists for each group.
The sentences in each list were pseudo-randomized, that is, not more than 3 sentences of same speed, or same predictability condition appeared consecutively.

### Procedure

Participants were asked to use headphones or earphones.
A sample of noise vocoded speech not used in the practice trial and the main experiment was provided so that the participants could adjust the loudness to a preferred level of comfort at the beginning of the experiment.
The participants were instructed to listen to the sentences and to type in the entire sentence by using the keyboard.
The time for typing in the response was not limited.
They were also informed at the beginning of the experiment that some of the sentences would be ‘noisy’ and not easy to understand, and in these cases, they were encouraged to guess what they might have heard.
They were not informed about the speed of speech being slow/fast or normal.
Eight practice trials with different levels of speech degradation were given to familiarize the participants with the task before presenting all 120 experimental trials with an inter-trial interval of 1000 ms.
