# Semantic predictability facilitates comprehension of degraded speech in a graded manner {#chapter-graded-prediction}
\chaptermark{Graded effect of predictability}

In the previous chapter we concluded that in a noisy channel, predictability facilitates comprehension of degraded speech only when listeners attended to the context.
A few lacunae in the study in Chapter \@ref(chapter-attention-prediction) warrant further examination and exploration of its the conclusion.
Firstly, there was an implicit assumption that all the noun-correct responses were borne out of correct identification of the context evoking words (i.e., verbs).
Instructions to the participants and the experimental design were made to test the effect of attention to context vs attention only to the target word such that
we could not test if participants identified the context correctly in [Experiment 1A](#experiment1a).
<!-- To make a similar comparison, we only measured final-word accuracy in [Experiment 1B](#experiment1b) as well. -->
<!-- We can overcome this limitation in the study reported in this chapter. -->
Secondly, we also did not consider if listeners adapted to the degraded speech, and how such an adaptation, if present, could modulate or interact with contextual facilitation.
And most importantly, we only showed that there is a difference between high and low predictability sentences ---
the granularity of predictability was not tested.
<!-- The theoretical question in this chapter will be on the nature of prediction. -->
Therefore, the aim of the study presented in this chapter is to address these limitations and examine if listeners form narrowed expectations or whether predictions are generated across a wide range of probable sentence endings in a graded manner.
We also take into account the accuracy of context identification (not just the accuracy of target word identification) as well as the possible learning effect due to an adaptation to the degraded speech.
The results showed that in contrast to the "narrowed expectations" view postulated for predictive processing of degraded speech,
listeners probabilistically preactivate upcoming words from a wide range of semantic space, not limiting only to highly probable sentence endings.
We also did not find any learning effect.
We speculate that when there is a trial-by-trial variation in semantic feature (e.g., sentence predictability), listeners do not adapt to low-level perceptual property (e.g., speech quality).

## Introduction

In the literature of speech perception and sentence processing, studies have argued that prediction is either probabilistic and graded, or it is an all-or-nothing phenomenon [see @Coltheart2004; @Kuperberg2016; @Luke2016].
Very few studies have investigated such theoretical questions within the domain of adverse listening conditions, specifically in degraded speech comprehension [e.g., @Strauss2013; see also @Corps2020; @vanOs2021].
@Strauss2013 posited that listeners cannot preactivate less predictable sentence endings in an adverse listening condition.
They proposed that the facilitatory effect of predictability is limited to only highly predictable sentence endings at a moderate level of spectral degradation of speech.
Although many studies support the general idea of Strau{\ss} and colleagues that predictability facilitates comprehension of degraded speech [e.g., @Hunter2018; @Obleser2010; @Sheldon2008a],
there have been no studies so far after Strauß and colleagues', to our knowledge, which examined the nature of predictability specifically in degraded speech comprehension.

In this chapter, our main aim is to replicate the previous findings of these predictability effects,
and extend them further by testing if listeners form narrowed expectations while listening to moderately degraded speech.
In line with @Strauss2013's argument, listeners can form predictions that are restricted to only highly probable sentence endings.
On the opposite, listeners can generate expectations about an upcoming word based on how likely the word is to appear in the context,
and hence form a probabilistic prediction.
We also test the presence of perceptual adaptation and its effect on contextual facilitation.
We set a metric of measurement of language comprehension that considers whether listeners correctly identified the context information.

## Background

#### Predictability effects in degraded speech perception
\noindent
We discussed in Chapter \@ref(chapter-background), Section \@ref(background-facilitatory-effect),
that some studies [@Obleser2007; @Obleser2010; @Sheldon2008a; see also, @Hunter2018] have already shown the facilitatory effect of predictability in comprehension of degraded speech.
For example, Obleser and colleagues compared high and low predictability sentences and observed contextual facilitation, in terms of the difference in response accuracy between high and low predictability sentences, at 8 channels and 4 channels noise vocoded speech in their [-@Obleser2007] and [-@Obleser2010] studies respectively.
These studies, however, were not designed to test the nature of predictability effects. <!--"narrowed expectations" account that was proposed in the *expectancy searchlight model* of @Strauss2013.-->

In a modified experimental design, @Strauss2013 varied the target word predictability by manipulating its expectancy (i.e., how expected the target word is given the verb) and typicality (i.e., co-occurrence of target word and the preceding verb).
They reported that at a moderate level of spectral degradation, N400 responses at highly predictable (strong-context and high-typical) words were smallest.
In contrast, they found that the N400 responses were largest at the strong-context, low typical words and the weak-context, low-typical words;
the responses at the latter two were not statistically different from each other.
The authors interpreted these findings as a facilitatory effect of sentence predictability which might be limited to only highly predictable sentence endings at a moderate level of spectral degradation.
They proposed it as an *expectancy searchlight model*, and suggested that listeners form *narrowed expectations* from a restricted semantic space when the sentence endings are highly predictable.
When the sentence endings are less predictable, listeners cannot preactivate those less predictable sentence endings in an adverse listening condition.
This is contrary to the view that readers and listeners form a probabilistic prediction of upcoming word in a sentence.
For example, @Nieuwland2018 showed in a large-scale replication study of @Delong2005 that the N400 amplitude at the sentence-final noun is directly proportional to its cloze probability across a range of high- and low-cloze words [see also, @Kochari2019; @Nicenboim2020].
@Heilbron2021 also showed that a probabilistic prediction model outperforms a constrained guessing model in predicting listeners' neural activities (MEG and EEG recordings),
suggesting that linguistic prediction is probabilistic and it is not limited only to the highly predictable sentence endings, but it operates broadly in a wide range of probable sentence endings.
However, when put in perspective with our research question, these studies were conducted in conditions without noise or degraded speech.
And those studies that examined degraded speech comprehension, used only two levels of semantic predictability (high and low).
The granularity and the nature of prediction remain yet to be tested in degraded speech comprehension.

#### Adaptation to degraded speech
\noindent
Listeners quickly adapt to novel speech with artificial acoustic distortions [@Dupoux1997]. 
With a repeated exposure to degraded speech, listeners' comprehension improves over time [@Samuel2009; @Guediche2014].
When the noise condition is constant throughout the experiment, listeners adapt to it and the performance (e.g., word recognition) improves with as little as 20 minutes of exposure [@Rosen1999].
For example, @Davis2005[Experiment 1] presented listeners with 6 channels noise vocoded speech and found an increase in the proportion of correctly reported words over the course of experiment.
Similarly, @Erb2013 presented participants with 4 channels noise vocoded speech and reached a similar conclusion.
In these experiments, only one speech degradation level (6 or 4 channels noise vocoded speech) was presented in one block.
There was no uncertainty about the next-trial speech degradation within a block from the participants' perspective,
i.e., the *global channel context* was certain or predictable.
Additionally, target word predictability was not varied.

When multiple types or levels of degraded speech signals are presented in a (pseudo-)randomized order within a block, then a listener is uncertain about the signal quality of any upcoming trial.
If such multiple levels of degradation are due to the presentation of multiple channels of noise vocoded speech, then the *global channel context* is unpredictable or uncertain.
This can influence perceptual adaptation such that
it might be totally absent with the change in the characteristics of auditory signal throughout an experiment [@Mattys2012].
In addition, trial-by-trial variability in the characteristics of distorted speech can impair word recognition [@Sommers1994; see also, @Dahan2006].
It can, thus, be speculated that if the noise vocoded speech varies from one trial to the next, then the adaptation to noise in this scenario might be different from the case in which spectral degradation is constant throughout the experiment.
Perceptual adaptation, however, is not limited to trial-by-trial variability of stimulus property.
Listeners can adapt to auditory signal at different time courses or time scales [@Atienza2002; see also, @Whitmire2016].
In addition to the differences in intrinsic trial-by-trial variability (that is involved in short timescale trial-by-trial adaptation),
the global differences in the presentation of vocoded speech can result in the general adaptation at a longer timescale
which can differ between predictable and unpredictable channel contexts.

Only a limited number of studies has looked at how next-trial noise-uncertainty and global context of speech property influence adaptation.
For example, words were presented at +3dB SNR and +10dB SNR in a word-recognition task in a pseudorandom order [@Vaden2013].
The authors wanted to minimize the certainty about the noise conditions in the block.
They proposed that an adaptive control system might be involved to optimize task the performance when the listeners are uncertain about an upcoming trial [@Eckert2016; @Vaden2015; @Vaden2016].
However, we cannot make a firm conclusion about perceptual adaptation *per se* from their studies as they do not report the change in performance over the course of experiment.
Similarly, Obleser and colleagues [@Obleser2007; @Obleser2010; @Hartwigsen2015] also presented listeners with noise vocoded sentences (ranging from 2 to 32 channels noise vocoding) in a pseudo-randomized order but did not report the presence or absence of perceptual adaptation.
In the above-mentioned studies, the authors did not compare participants’ task performance in a blocked design against the presentation in a pseudo-randomized block of different degradation levels to make an inference about general adaptation to degraded speech at a longer timescale and adaptation at a shorter timescale on a trial-by-trial level.

#### Measurement of language comprehension
\noindent
How we measure language comprehension has rarely been guided by any specific theoretical motive in the existing literature.
There is a discrepancy across studies in how language comprehension in degraded speech in quantified.
Some studies that reported contextual facilitation in degraded speech comprehension used proportion of correctly reported *final* words only [e.g., @Hunter2018; @Obleser2010; @Sheldon2008a].
@Obleser2007 quantified language comprehension as the proportion of correctly identified key words in SPIN sentences.
@Erb2013 and @Hakonen2017 used *report scores* [@Peelle2013] that measure proportion of correctly recognized words per sentence as an index of language comprehension.
Such inconsistencies make cross-study comparison difficult.
Additionally, none of these measures take into account if listeners have correctly identified the context [cf. @Amichetti2018; @Marrufo2019]
which should have been the most important factor to be considered in the first place.

#### The present study
\noindent
Stemming from the results of Chapter \@ref(chapter-attention-prediction), and from the motivation driven by the open questions outlined in the beginning of this chapter, the goals of the study in this chapter were threefold:
The first goal was to replicate the facilitatory effect of predictability, and examine the nature of predictability, i.e., to test if listeners form narrowed expectations.
Obleser and colleagues [e.g., @Obleser2007; @Obleser2010] have shown predictability effects (or contextual facilitation) to appear only at a moderate level of speech degradation by using only two levels of predictability (low and high).
Our use of three levels of target word predictability (low, medium and high) will let us test the narrowed expectations view [@Strauss2013] by also taking into account the accuracy of context.
If the listeners form narrowed predictions only for the target words with high cloze probability, then the facilitatory effect of semantic prediction will be observed only at these highly predictable sentence endings.
Listeners’ response to the target words with medium and low cloze probability would be quite similar as these two fall out of the range of narrow prediction.
However, if the listeners’ predictions are not restricted to highly predictable target words, then they form predictions across a wide range of context proportional to the probability of occurrence of the target word.
In addition to highly predictable sentence endings, listeners will also form predictions for less predictable sentence endings.
Such predictions will depend on the probability of occurrence of the target words.
In other words, listeners form predictions also for less expected sentence endings;
and the semantic space of prediction depends on the probability of occurrence of those sentence endings.
The addition of sentences with medium cloze target words thus allows us to differentiate whether listeners form all-or-nothing prediction restricted to high cloze target words, or a probabilistic prediction for words across a wide range of cloze probability.

There is a variation in the sentences we use, i.e., they are low, medium and high predictability sentences, and they are degraded at different levels of spectral degradation.
So our second goal was to investigate the role of uncertainty about next-trial speech features on perceptual adaptation by varying the global channel context on the comprehension of degraded speech.
To study this, we presented sentences of different levels of predictability blocked by each channel conditions (*predictable channel context*), and pseudo-randomized across all channels (*unpredictable channel context*).
Based on previous findings, we expected that in the unpredictable channel context (i.e., when sentences are presented in a random order of spectral degradation) participants’ word recognition performance will be worse than in the predictable channel context [i.e., when the sentences are blocked by noise-vocoding, @Garrido2011; @Sommers1994; @Vaden2013].
To further examine perceptual adaptation, we also considered the effect of trial number in the analyses.

And third, we aimed at measuring language comprehension with a metric that reflects the participants' correct or incorrect identification of the context.
If participants do not understand the context and we only measure the recognition of final word, this might not truly reflect the effect of contextual facilitation.

## Methods

### Participants

We recruited a group of participant via Prolific Academic and assigned them to the *predictable channel context* (n = 50; $\pm$ SD = 23.6 $\pm$ 3.2 years; age range = 18 -- 30 years; 14 females).
We created *unpredictable channel context* group from participants (n = 48; $\bar{x}$  $\pm$ SD = 24.44 $\pm$ 3.5 years; age range = 18 -- 31 years; 16 females) from [Experiment 1B](#experiment1b).
All participants were native speakers of German residing in Germany.
We recruited onlty those participants who had reported to not have any hearing disorder, speech-language disorder, or neurological disorder.

### Materials

We used the same stimuli described in Chapter \@ref(chapter-methods) (Section \@ref(experimental-materials)).
We used 120 sentences each for low predictability, medium predictability, and high predictability sentences that differed in the cloze probability of sentence final target words.
Their mean cloze probabilities were $0.022\pm0.027$ ($\bar{x}\pm SD$; range = $0.00-0.09$) for low predictability sentences, $0.274\pm0.134$ ($\bar{x}\pm SD$; range = $0.1-0.55$) for medium predictability sentences, and $0.752\pm0.123$ ($\bar{x}\pm SD$; range = $0.56-1.00$) for high predictability sentences.

In the unpredictable channel context, each participant was presented with 120 unique sentences: 40 low predictability, 40 medium predictability, and 40 high predictability sentences.
Channel condition (i.e., degradation level) was also balanced across each sentence type, i.e., in each of low, medium, and high predictability sentences, 10 sentences passed through each noise vocoding channels --- 1, 4, 6, and 8 --- were presented.
This resulted into 12 experimental lists.
The sentences in each list were pseudo-randomized, that is, not more than three sentences of same noise condition (i.e., same noise vocoding channel), or same predictability condition appeared consecutively.
This randomization confirmed the uncertainty of next-trial speech quality (or degradation) in the global context of the experiment.

The same set of stimuli and experimental lists were used in the predictable channel context.
Each participant was presented with 120 unique sentences blocked by channel conditions, i.e., blocked by noise vocoding channels.
There were four blocks of stimuli, one for each channel condition (i.e., degradation level).
Thirty sentences were presented in each of the four blocks.
In the first block, all sentences were 8 channels noise vocoded, followed by the blocks of 6 channels, 4 channels, and 1 channel noise vocoded speech consecutively [@Sheldon2008a].
Within each block, 10 low predictability, 10 medium predictability and 10 high predictability sentences were presented.
All the sentences were pseudo-randomized so that not more than three sentences of the same predictability condition appeared consecutively in each block.
This confirmed there was a certainty of next-trial speech quality (within each block) and an uncertainty of next-trial sentence predictability across all four blocks.

### Procedure

Participants were asked to use earphones or headphones.
A prompt to adjust loudness was displayed at the beginning of the experiment:
A noise vocoded sound not used in the main experiment was presented, and participants were asked to adjust the loudness at their level of comfort.
One spoken sentence was presented in each trial with an inter-trial interval of 1000ms.
Eight practice trials were presented before presenting 120 experimental trials.
They were asked to enter what they had heard (i.e., to type in the entire sentence).
Guessing was encouraged.
The response was not timed.<!-- Time limit to respond was not imposed on the participants.-->
The experiment was about 40 minutes long.

## Analyses

In the sentences used in our experiment, verbs evoke predictability of the sentence-final noun.
Therefore, the effect of predictability (evoked by the verb) on language comprehension can be rightfully measured if we consider only those trials in which participants identify the verbs correctly.
Verb-correct trials were considered as the sentence in which participants identified the context independent of whether they correctly understood the sentence final target noun.
Morphological inflections and typos were considered as correct.
We first filtered out those trials in which verbs were not identified correctly, i.e., trials with incorrect verbs.
Therefore, we excluded 2469 out of 5760 trials in unpredictable channel context and 2374 out of 6000 trials in predictable channel context from the analyses.
The 1 channel noise vocoding condition was dropped from the analyses as there were no correct responses in any of the trials in this condition.

<!-- We preprocessed and analysed data in R-Studio (Version 3.6.1; R Core Team, 2019) following the procedure described in [Chapter 4.4.4]{#analysis-main}. -->
We analyzed response accuracy with generalized linear mixed models following the procedure described in Chapter \@ref(chapter-stats) (Section \@ref(analysis-main)).
Binary responses (correct/incorrect) for all participants in both groups (predictable channel context and unpredictable channel context) were fit with a [binomial logistic mixed-effects model]{#binomial-logistic-mixed-effects-model} [@Jaeger2006; @Jaeger2008].
Noise condition (categorical; 4, 6, and 8 channels noise vocoding), target word predictability (categorical; high predictability, medium predictability, and low predictability), global channel context (categorical; predictable channel context and unpredictable channel context), and the interaction of noise condition and target word predictability were included in the fixed effects.
We applied treatment contrast for noise condition (8 channels as a baseline; factor levels: 8 channels, 4 channels, 6 channels) and sliding difference contrast for target word predictability (factor levels: medium predictability, low predictability, high predictability) and channel context (factor levels: unpredictable, predictable).

## Results and discussion

<!--In this experiment, we tested i) whether predictability facilitates language comprehension only at a moderate level of spectral degradation, and ii) whether adaptation to degraded speech influences language comprehension.-->
We observed that the mean response accuracy increased with an increase in number of noise vocoding channels from 4 to 6 to 8, and with an increase in target word predictability from low to medium to high (see Figure X.X).
This trend was consistent across both the channel contexts;
Figure X.X and Figure Y.Y show this trend for predictable channel context (i.e., blocked design) and unpredictable channel context (i.e., randomized design) respectively.
Mean accuracies across all conditions are given in Table X and Y, and Figure X.X.

These observations are confirmed by the results of statistical analyses (Table XYZ).
We found a significant main effect of channel condition indicating that the response accuracy was higher in the 8 channels
than in the 4 channels ($\beta$ = -2.87, SE = .22, *z* (6917) = -13.1, *p* <.001) and
6 channels ($\beta$ = -.66, SE = .19, *z* (6917) = -3.42, *p* < .001).
There was a significant main effect of target word predictability suggesting that response accuracy was lower at low predictability sentences
than both high predictability sentences ($\beta$ = 2.18, SE = .3, *z* (6917) = 7.2, *p* < .001) and
medium predictability sentences ($\beta$ = -.52, SE = .27, *z* (6917) = -1.97, *p* = .049).
We also found a significant interaction between channel condition and target word predictability ($\beta$ = -.71, SE = .29, *z* (6917) = -2.44, *p* = .015).

We performed a subgroup analyses on each noise channel condition
<!-- The same procedure as described above was followed. -->
which revealed that the interaction was driven by the effect of predictability at 4 channels:
The accuracy at high predictability sentences was higher than medium predictability sentences ($\beta$ = 1.14, SE = .37, *z* (1608) = 3.1, *p* < .001),
which in turn was also higher than low predictability sentences ($\beta$ = 1, SE = .24, *z* (1608) = 4.2, *p* < .001).
There was no significant difference in response accuracy between low predictability and high predictability sentences
at both 6 channels ($\beta$ = .33, SE = .32, *z* (2590) = 1.04, *p* = .3)
and 8 channels ($\beta$ = -.014, SE = .32, *z* (2719) = -.04, *p* = .97).
<!--However, response accuracy was higher in high predictability than in medium predictability sentences
at both 6 channels ($\beta$ = 1.83, SE = .65, *z* (2590) = 2.83, p < .005)
and 8 channels ($\beta$ = 1.54, SE = 61, *z* (2719) = 2.54, *p* = .011).-->

We also found a significant main effect of global channel context which showed that the response accuracy was higher in predictable channel context than in unpredictable channel context ($\beta$ = -.27, SE = .14, *z* (6917) = -2.02, *p* = .04).

Further, to test the effect of practice on adaptation to degraded speech, we added trial number as a fixed effect in the maximal model.
Note that there were 30 trials in each block in the predictable channel context (i.e., blocked design).
For comparability, we divided unpredictable channel context (i.e., randomized design) into four blocks in the analysis.
<!-- Then following the same procedure as above, we obtained an optimal model. -->
We did not find a significant main effect of trial number indicating that the response accuracy did not change throughout the experiment ($\beta$ = -.0004, SE = .01, *z* (6917) = -.05, *p* = .97).
It remained constant within each block in the predictable channel context ($\beta$ = -.02, SE = .01, *z* (3291) = -1.43, *p* = .15) as well as in the unpredictable channel context ($\beta$ = .01 SE = .01, *z* (3291) = 1.05, *p* = .29).

## Conclusion

The present study had three goals: i) to examine if previously reported facilitatory effect of semantic predictability  is restricted to only highly predictable sentence endings;
ii) to assess the role of perceptual adaptation on the facilitation of language comprehension by sentence predictability; and
iii) to use and establish a sensitive metric to measure language comprehension that takes into account whether listeners benefited from the semantic context of the sentence they have listened to.

Results of our study showed the expected interaction between predictability and degraded speech, that is, language comprehension was better for high-cloze than for low-cloze target words when the speech signal was moderately degraded by noise vocoding through 4 channels, while the effect of predictability was absent when speech was not intelligible (noise vocoding through 1 channel).
These results are fully in line with @Obleser2010;
we partly included identical sentences from their study in the present study (see Appendix A).
Importantly, in contrast to their study, we had also created sentences with medium-cloze target words (which were intermediate between high-cloze and low-cloze target words) and found that the effect of predictability was also significant when comparing sentences with medium-cloze target words against sentences with low-cloze target words at 4 channels noise vocoding condition.
Recognition of a target word was dependent on its level of predictability (measured by cloze probability), and correct recognition was not just limited to high-cloze target words.
These significant differences in response accuracy between medium-cloze and low-cloze target words, and between medium-cloze and high-cloze target words at noise-vocoding through 4 channels show that the sentence-final word recognition is facilitated by semantic predictability in a graded manner.
This is in line with the findings from the ERP literature where it has been observed that semantic predictability, in terms of cloze probability of target word of a sentence, modulates semantic processing, indexed by N400, in a graded manner [@Delong2005; @Wlotko2012; @Nieuwland2018].

The interpretation of the observed graded effect of semantic predictability at the moderate level of spectral degradation (i.e., at noise-vocoding through 4 channels) provides a novel insight into how listeners form prediction when the bottom-up input is compromised.
That is, in an adverse listening condition, listeners rely more on top-down semantic prediction than on bottom-up acoustic-phonetic cues.
However, such a reliance on top-down prediction is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon; instead, listeners form a probabilistic prediction of the target word.
The effect of target word predictability on comprehension is not sharply focused solely on high-cloze target words like a ‘searchlight’ as proposed by Strauss and colleagues.
But rather it is spread across a wide range including low-cloze and medium-cloze target words.
As the cloze probability of the target words decreases from high to low, the focus of the searchlight becomes less precise.
<!-- ## Conclusion -->

In conclusion, this study provides novel insights into predictive language processing when bottom-up signal quality is compromised and uncertain:
We show that while processing moderately degraded speech, listeners form top-down predictions across a wide range of semantic space that is not restricted within highly predictable sentence endings.
In contrast to the narrowed expectation view, comprehension of words ranging from low- to high-cloze probability, including medium-cloze probability, is facilitated in a graded manner while listening to a moderately degraded speech.
We also found better speech comprehension when individuals were likely to have adapted to the noise condition in the blocked design compared to the randomized design.
We did not find learning effects at the trial-by-trial level of perceptual adaption --- it may be that the adaptation was hampered by variation in higher-level semantic features (i.e., target word predictability).
We also argue that for the examination of semantic predictability effects during language comprehension, the analyses of response accuracy should be based on the trials in which context evoking words are correctly identified in the first place to make sure that listeners make use of the contextual cues instead of analyzing general word recognition scores.
