# Discussion and conclusion {#chapter-conclusion}

While there is no doubt that human readers an listeners use context information and form semantic predictions,
there have been questions about the ubiquity of predictive nature of language processing, in particular, language comprehension.
In this thesis, we examined predictive language processing while listeners are presented with degraded speech.
By manipulating top-down and bottom-up processes, we examined the interactions of these two processes in understanding speech in adverse listening conditions.
Our findings support the predictive processing account of language comprehension.
Below we synthesize the results from the experiments in the preceding chapters, and put forth a nuanced argument in favor of the facilitatory effect of predictability in degraded speech comprehension.

## Summary of the main findings

In Chapter 5, we investigated the role of attention to sentence context in semantic prediction.
The results showed that listeners can use context information and form predictions about upcoming linguistic units only if they are attending to the context in the sentence.
This finding highlights the critical role of attention in prediction in degraded speech comprehension.
It also shows that prediction is not an automatic phenomenon;
rather, prediction depends on listeners' attention to the context, and them forming its meaning representation.

In Chapter 6, we further examined the nature of contextual facilitation that was observed in Chapter 5.
The results showed that semantic predictability facilitated comprehension of degraded speech at a moderate level of degradation.
Importantly, such predictability effect was graded in nature.
The latter finding refuted the claims made by 'narrowed expectations' views of Stra√üe and colleagues [@Strauss2013].

In Chapter 7, we examined if the facilitatory effect of predictability at the moderate spectral degradation is influenced by bottom-up factor, like temporal degradation of speech (i.e., fast and slow speech).
The findings show that fast speech incurs processing cost when the sentence endings are less predictable from the context, therefore, contextual facilitation is reduced in fast speech.
In slow speech, on the other hand, no change is observed in the facilitatory effect, as the listeners are at their optimal level of performance already at the normal speech rate.

Results from Chapters 5 and 6 also showed that listeners do not adapt to degraded speech despite being exposed to it throughout the experiment.
The change in target word predictability, i.e., semantic feature of the speech signal potentially interferes in adaptation to lower level perceptual property of the speech.

Taken together, the findings from these three chapters can be stated as:
At a normal speech rate, when listeners attend to sentence context, semantic predictability facilitates language comprehension at a moderate level of spectral degradation.

## Theoretical and practical implications

## Limitation
 - Iron law /Stanovic's law

## Concluding remarks
 
Dont introduce new material, e.g., theories, results, data, etc.
Reflect on the results, chapters.
Create a satisfactory ending.

Sell your wares.
  You have made original contribution: "My original contribution to knowledge is ..."

Conclusion is more than a summary. Summary is just a part of the conclusion. Give 'what' happened in the thesis but also 'why'.
Why do the chapters matter?

How you have contributed to the discipline? Different than contribution to the knowledge.
Tell about local context. Position in the world.

What went wrong? What would you do differently?

Future work. It follows from 'what went wrong'.

Extendability. What / how to extend from your work.

Impact. Impact to the society; social, theoretical, financial, etc.
This is different than contribution to knowledge and discipline.

Writing matters.
Why should someone give a damn about your thesis?

Don't underclaim, dont't overclaim.
About implications. What does the summary mean, what answers does it provide, does it not provide.
Offer a series of pathways to future research.
[My thesis has done X, it leads to Y; cite literature.] --> repeat recursively.

All in all, conclusions mean: Why does the thesis matter? Don't give new material. Give a link between chapters.

Don't say what you think, say what the data speaks.

Previously reported facilitatory effect of semantic predictability comes from studies conducted in laboratory setups. The current experiment was conducted online. There is a possibility that different participants used different hearing devices. Such variability in hearing devices could not be controlled for in our experiment although the participants were restricted to using only desktop/laptop computers. However, we have no reason to believe that these variance sources are systematically correlated with our between-group manipulation (global channel context) and the effects are constant within subjects. Moreover, the main finding of this study, i.e., the graded effect of semantic predictability, is observed in both the groups.
