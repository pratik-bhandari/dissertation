One of the features that distinguishes us humans from other species is our ability to communicate using verbal language.
We speak. We listen. We understand.
This seemingly straight forward path of communication (i.e., speak-listen-understand) goes through a plenty of hindrances.
One of them being adverse listening condition.
We are hardly in a noise-free environment.
There can be noise in the background during a conversation;
poor signal transmission via a Zoom call can render a speaker's speech distorted;
a listener can have hearing loss, or he might be wearing a hearing prostesis like cochlear implant and hearing aid.
Despite any or all of these, the peripheral auditory processing, and the central language processing systems function such that most of the times we understand what is being said.
How does the cognitive system achieve this feat of understanding speech that is distorted by so many internal and external factors?
One of the 'tactics' that human language comprehenders rely upon is the use of preexisting linguistic knowledge, information about the world, and importantly, the context information to form predictions about linguistic events that are yet to be encountered.

Let's take the following sentence, for example:
    
(1) The day was breezy so the boy went outside to fly ...

Most of the listeners would expect the final word to be *a kite* in this sentence.
The words preceding the ellipses provide a context.
<!--It says that the day is pleasant and windy. <!--regarding the breeziness of the *day*.-->
A reader, or a listener can utilize their knowledge about what a *boy* would ideally do *outside* when a day is *breezy*.
This would lead the reader/listener to predict that the sentence continuation is most likely *a kite* and not any other word like a rocket [@Delong2005; cf. @Nieuwland2020a].
This particular sentence was used by @Delong2005 in a reading study which also applies to the auditory domain [see @Altmann2007].

While listening to a degraded speech, listeners can use the context information and form predictions.
The nature of prediction in comprehension of speech that is degraded by noise vocoding is not a settled issue:
Is prediction probabilistic, or is it an all-or-nothing phenomenon?
However, one question that one might raise prior to the nature of prediction is, why study degraded speech comprehension in the first place when we do not come across it on our day-to-day conversation.
There are two facets to the answer of this question.
First, we cannot fully understand how speech comprehension system in humans operate unless we study how it responds to novel sounds.
If predictive processing is the fundamental operating mechanism of human language comprehension as it is claimed to be, then it is imperative we examine the claim in different listening conditions, with novel auditory stimuli.
After all, different paradigms have shown limits in predictive language processing accounts.
Secondly, a X% of population has hearing difficulty, and y% receives cochlear implant.
Degraded speech mimics the auditory input that cochlear implantees receive.
To better understand language comprehension in this section of population, and to explore the difficulties that they face compared to normal hearing population, the use of degraded speech is important.

Therefore, we study both top-down predictive processes as well as bottom-up auditory processes and their interactions in comprehension of degraded speech.
While doing so, we address the following challenges:

(i)   **Replication crisis**\
Almost all the disciplines of cognitive science -- anthropology, computer science, linguistics, neuroscience, and psychology -- are suffering the so-called replication crisis [e.g., @Sanderson2008; @OSC2015; @Ebersole2016; @Cockburn2020].
The results of an experiment do not hold up consistently when conducted again by another group of researcher.
For example, in a multi-lab collaborative study, @Nieuwland2020a did not find the same N400 effect at article (a/an) that @Delong2005 reported 15 years earlier.
<!-- Many PhD studies are founded on established findings taking them on face value, with little to no attempt on replication. -->
This thesis attempts to test if predictability effect in degraded speech comprehension is replicable.
<!--We argue that it is imperetive to replicate an experiment before furthering its line of argument and testing the hypotheses which it builds upon.
 -->

(ii)    **Limitations of predictive processing**\
A number of authors claim that predictive processing is the fundamental nature of human cognition, and thus, by definition, also of language processing [@Clark2013; @Friston2020; @Friston2020b; @Lupyan2015].
At the same time, many studies have shown limitations in predictive language processing, for example, due to memory, aging, experimental paradigm, literacy, etc. [@Huettig2016; @Mishra2012; @Federmeier2010; @Huettig2019]. 
<!-- This theoretical aspect of predictive language processing is not clear in the case of degraded speech comprehension. -->
This thesis examines the factors like, auditory attention and speed of information flow, that can be prerequisites and limitations of semantic prediction in understanding degraded speech.

(iii)   **Debate on the nature of prediction**\
There are at least two school of thoughts which argue that prediction is either a all-or-none phenomenon, or probabilistic in nature.
In degraded speech comprehension, only one study has empirically investigated the theoretical postulation that prediction is restricted only for highly predictable sentence endings [@Strauss2013].
This thesis attempts to undertake the challenge of teasing apart the nature of prediction in degraded speech comprehension.
<!-- A limited number of studies have attempted to examine the form vs word level prediction, and only one study has postulated the nature of prediction (e.g., graded vs all-or-nothing) with emperical support [@Corps2020; @Strauss2013]. -->

(iv)   **Multitudes of speech distortion**\
Speech signal is distorted by multiple factors in real life.
Our conversational environment is noisy, or the signal is degraded during transmission.
On the top of that, people might speak fast or slow varying difficulty to process the information.
Listeners can adapt to such degraded speech signal as shown by earlier studies;
or trying to focus on the ever-changing lexical task might not let them adapt at all even when only one form of distortion is applied to the speech signal.
When loaded with more than one form of distortion, it is not clear how the context will help the listeners' comprehension.
<!-- Difficulty in bottom-up processing can interact with top-down processing. -->
And this thesis undertakes this challenge of understanding how multiple form of bottom-up processing difficulty interacts with the aid that top-down predictive processing provides, if at all.

The research goals of the thesis meet with these challenges.
The studies addressing the challenges outlined above will contribute to do XYZ.
In the next two sections, we present the research goals of this thesis, and the general overview of the all the chapters that follow.

## Research goals

The interaction between top-down and bottom-up processes has been extensively discussed and examined in the literature of reading studies and clear speech comprehension.
In this thesis, our aim to investigate such interaction, and the role of other top down process (e.g., attention) in comprehension of degraded speech.
<!-- We do so, for example, by testing the proposals of some predictive language processing frameworks.\ -->
The goals of the research in correspondence to the central challenges of this thesis are outlined below.

**Goal 1**:
The first goal of this thesis is to replicate the standard facilitatory effect of predictability given our experimental materials and method of speech degradation.
As we have mentioned earlier, it is a problem in the field that well known effects are not replicable.
If we can replicate the facilitatory effect of predictability, then it will move the research towards garnering more evidence of the *effect*.
It will also provide a reliable foundation to test if other factors (e.g., speed of information processing) have any influence on the facilitatory effect.

**Goal 2**:
The second goal of this thesis is to examine the nature of predictability effect.
In the current literature of predictive processing, a debate exists about the nature of predictability effect:
whether it is an all-or-none phenomenon or if it is probabilistic in nature.
With carefully designed experiments, this thesis aims to tease apart this distinction between these two proposed nature of prediction in language comprehension.

**Goal 3**:
The third goal of this thesis is to examine the role of top-down factors other than semantic prediction in degraded speech comprehension.
Specifically, the role of attention to speech stream is of interest in this thesis, as we know from non-speech auditory perception literature that attention can modulate predictability effects.
This thesis will aim to establish if attention to different parts of degraded speech stream aids, or hampers facilitatory effects of top-down predictions.

**Goal 4**:
The fourth goal of this thesis is to examine if variation in information flow affects facilitatory effect of predictability.
The flow of information is not constant in any conversation as speakers speak fast or slow.
We will therefore test if an increase or decrease in speech rate impedes overall comprehension of degraded speech,
and if it impedes or further aids the facilitatory effect of predictability.

**Goal 5**:
The fifth goal of this thesis is to examine if listeners adapt to degraded speech.
Studies that report adaptation and learning effect often overlook the effect of context that comes along with the perceptual property of the speech.
It is not reasonable to argue that adaptation is independent of any lexical property of the speech that contains context information.
Therefore, in this thesis we take into account the variability of context information across sentences even if they are at the same level of degradation.
We will test if adaptation to bottom-up perceptual property of speech is influenced by top-down semantic property of speech.

**Goal 6**:
The sixth goal of this thesis is to establish and consistently use a sensitive metric for the measurement of language comprehension.
In the study of speech perception and language comprehension, different researchers use different measurement metric.
This becomes a problem specially when the effect of context in comprehension is being discussed.
In this thesis, we advocate for the use of a metric that takes into account whether participants (in)correctly utilize the context evoking word in a sentence to measure language comprehension or word recognition accuracy.

## Research contributions

The research reported in this thesis contributes to the studies of speech perception, language processing, predictive processing, language science, audiology, psycholingusitics, psychology, and broadly to cognitive science.
The studies in this thesis helps us understand the processing and comprehension of novel speech that humans do not generally encounter day-to-day.
Nevertheless, this opens a window towards understanding how human auditory and language processing mechanism work to help us understand speech in adverse listening condition.
In an applied setup, this informs us about the speech perception in cochlear implantees. WRITE UP MORE HERE.

*   **A metric of language comprehension**\
We propose and successfully use a metric of language comprehension that reflect listeners' use of context information.
This metric does not merely measure how many words are correctly identified.
Rather, it considers the fact that in the study of effect of predictability, how well a context is recognized should also be taken into account, 
and thus it measures word recognition accuracy in the sentences in which context is correctly recognized in the first place.
The use of such a metric improves interpretation of contextual facilitation across studies, which lacks in the extant literature.
Goal 6 corresponds to this research contribution which is brought about by consistent use of this metric in Chapters 6, 7 and 8.

*   **Nature of prediction**\
First and foremost, we replicate previous findings that predictability indeed facilitates comprehension of degraded speech at a moderate level of degradation.
This is of great value given the discussion on replication crisis in different domains of cognitive sciences.
Our evidence shows that such facilitatory effect of prediction is graded in nature; it is not an all-or-none phenomenon.
In the existing debate between all-or-nothing vs graded prediction, our findings clearly show that prediction in degraded speech comprehension is graded in nature.
Goals 1 and 2 correspond to this research contribution which is brought about by the experiment described in Chapter 6.

*   **Limitation in predictive language processing**\
We show that predictive processing all by itself cannot explain how listeners understand degraded speech.
Although top-down predictions facilitate comprehension, we show that attention to context is the prerequisite for such a contextual facilitation.
Only when listeners attend to the context information and form its meaning representation, then top-down predictions can facilitate comprehension of degraded speech.
Without proper attentional allocation, contextual facilitation cannot be observed.
Goal 3 corresponds to this research contribution which is brought about by the experiment described in Chapter 5.

*   **Variability in information flow and its effect on top-down prediction**\
We show that different rates of information flow -- increase or decrease in rate of speech -- have different effects in language comprehension that is brought about primarily by the effect in ease or difficulty in processing sentences with less predictable endings.
Although the increase in the speed of information flow makes it difficult to encode the context information resulting in impeded contextual facilitation,
the decrease in the speed does not necessarily enhance encoding the context information while listening to moderately degraded speech.
This is one of the very few studies highlighting the role of speed of flow of information in contextual facilitation when the speech is modertely degraded.
Goal 4 corresponds to this research contribution which is brought about by the experiment described in Chapter 7.

*   **Adaptation to degraded speech**\
We show that listeners do not adapt to degraded speech which is opposite to some of the recent findings of speech perception experiments from other labs.
When listeners are working in a linguistic task in which the lexical cues vary on every trial, their cognitive resources are strained by lexical-semantic cues rather than acoustic-phonetic cues.
Thus, they don't show any adaptation effect; every trial is effectively a *novel* trial for them.
Goal 5 corresponds to this research contribution which is brought about by the experiment described mainly in Chapter 6, and continued in Chapter 7.


## Overview of the thesis

The central theme of this thesis is the study of the interaction between top-down predictions and bottom-up auditory processes in degraded speeech comprehension.
Although there are studies showing reliance on prediction at a moderate level of speech degradation,
this thesis replicated such findings focusing on theoretical question of the nature of such predictive processing.
The studies in this thesis examined the factors -- attention and rate of information flow -- that modulate semantic prediction,
and also showed that listeners do not adapt to degraded speech contrary to some previously reported findings.

**Chapter 2** provides a background on the rest of the chapters.
It provides an overview of degraded speech comprehension, predictive language processing, and existing metrices of measuring word recognition and language comprehension.

**Chapter 3** describes the stimuli used in all the experiments in this thesis.
It provides an overview of cloze rating, speech processing, and online data collection method.

**Chapter 4** provides an overview of the statistical tests employed for data analyses.
Binomial logistic mixed effects modeling was performed on the data from all the experiments.
This chapter provides a background on this statistical procedure,
and how it is conduced on R.

## Speech degradation

Speech can be distorted by variability in speakers’ production, like, accented speech, soft/rapid speech, or it can arise from listener-related factors like, hearing loss, auditory processing disorder.
It can also be a result of noise from transmission, like ambient noise, or distortion in the transmission (e.g., telephone line).
All these sources of distortion make listening condition adverse.
In laboratory setup, the effect of speech distortion, and the mechanism of listening in adverse listening condition is studied using artificial distortion of speech.
For example, white or pink noise signal is superimposed on the top of speech signal so as to add a background noise.\

In the early 1950s, plastic tapes with magnetic recorder were mechanically cut, spliced and pasted (named as *chop-splice method*) to increase the rate of speech [@Garvey1953].
Such a method was developed used to overcome the effect of frequency shift on intelligibility that was an undesired result of accelerated speech recorded on sound film or discs in the late 1920s [@Fletcher1929].
In recent days, algorithms like Pitch Synchronous Overlap-Add Technique [PSOLA; @Charpentier1986; @Moulines1990] and Overlap-Add Technique Based on Waveform Similarity [WSOLA; @Verhelst1993] are used to compress or elongate an auditory signal so as to change the rate of speech.
These methods preserve the phonemic properties of speech to a large extent (see Section X.X.X).

In the same vein, noise-vocoding is used to remove the spectral detail of the speech signal only leaving its temporal and periodicity cues (see Section X.X.X).
Noise-vocoding was initially developed as a means to reduce the information in speech signal to be transmitted through the telephone line [@Dudley1939; @Vocoder1940] --- [Re-read this thoroughly].
Shannon and colleagues later used the same technique as an analogue to cochlear implant [@Shannon1995; @Loizou1999; @Shannon2004] – number of channels used in a cochlear implant are similar to the number of noise-vocoding channels in terms of their speech output and intelligibility [… cite probably Wagner et al. …].

## Comprehension of degraded speech

The first factor that determines the intelligibility of noise-vocoded speech is the number of channels.
With an increase in noise-vocoding channels, speech intelligibility increases [e.g., @Davis2005; @Shannon1995].
For example, speech processed through 8 channels noise vocoding is more intelligible than the speech processed through 4 channels noise vocoding [@Loizou1999].
Participant related variables (age, vocabulary), test materials (words, sentences, accented speech), and listening conditions (quiet, background noise) also influence the intelligibility of noise vocoding speech.
Accuracy is higher for sentences than for words in isolation (CITE).
Compared to quiet, response accuracy was reduced when listeners were presented with vocoded speech in the presence of a background noise.
At the same level of degradation, accuracy is higher for younger adults than for older adults, i.e., with age, keeping all other variables constant, comprehension of degraded speech decreases.
Other factors like sentence context and vocabulary also play a role, which will be discussed below.
In sum, comprehension of degraded speech is a not only the amount of spectral details available, but also other listener and speaker related factors.
How a listener utilizes available context information to 'make-up' for the impoverished auditory information is the critical factor determining intelligibility and comprehension of degraded speech.

### Role of sentence context

Literature from sentence reading provides us with an insight how readers use the information available as the words are presented to them to make predictions about what word they'll see next.
In visual world paradigm, @Altmann1999 showed that a listeners predict upcoming word of a sentence using the cue provide by the sentence context.
For example, they presented participants a picture of four objects: cake, XXX, XXX, and XXX while the participants were listening to the sentence '*The boy will eat the* ...'.
Even before hearing *cake*, participants fixated at the picture of cake.
This finding has been replicated multiple times [@Kamide2003; @Altmann2007; CITE other recent papers] in different languages [@MISHRA...].
This is observable in behavioral measures as well as electrophysiological measures.\
@Kutas1984 reported smaller N400 amplitude for highly probable sentence endings than for less probable sentence endings given different sentence contexts.
They found that the N400 amplitude was more sensitive to sentence ending than to the constrain imposed by the preceding words.
-- Check new studies on this line --
@Delong2005 showed that listeners form probabilistic predictions about upcoming words in a sentence.
In a highly predictable sentence context like 'The day was breezy so the boy went outside to fly …', N400 amplitude was much smaller for an expected continuation 'a kite' than for an unexpected continuation 'an airplane'.
This study has been further replicated in Spanish-English bilinguals [CITE] showing that when presented with ... ... ...
Similarly, it has been observed that readers tend to skip the predictable words more than unpredictable words while reading, and predictable words are read faster than unpredictable words [@Frisson2005; @Rayner2011].
Semantic context already provides listeners information about what the predictable word is going to be, therefore their fixation time on the predictable words is lesser than unpredictable words, and it takes lesser time to read the predictable words.\
Taken together, these studies show that as the sentence unfolds, a human comprehender forms the meaning representation of the available context information, and generates prediction about what linguistic input is going to come next.\

In a noisy environment, however, it is difficult to understand the context itself.
While reading text that is visually degraded, readers rely on the available context information [e.g., @Clark2021].
Listeners generally rely on sentence context moreso in an adverse listening condition than in a clear listening environment.
For example, @Sheldon2008a showed that when the speech signal is degraded, word recognition is improved by sentence context in both younger and older adults.
They presented listeners with senteces with high and low context information, noise-vocoded at different levels of spectral degradation.
They found that response accuracy was higher for sentences with high context information than for the sentences with low context information.
In cochlear implantees, XYZ et al., have shown that high predictability sentences result in higher accuracy than low predictability sentences in a word recognition task.
Contrary to the findings of most of the studies using clean speech and reading clean text, sentence context does not *always* help in comprehension of all noise-vocoded speech.
When the noise-vocoded speech is least degraded, listeners might rely mostly on the bottom-up auditory input than on top-down predictions generated from the sentence context; hence, context does not render benefit in this case.
For example, in the 32-channels noise-vocoded speech in @Obleser2010, sentence context, and consecutively top-down semantic prediction does not yield any benefit in sentence comprehension when compared to 4-channels noise-vocoded speech.\

In summary, sentence context provides information necessary to generate top-down predictions.
Listeners use this context information and form predictions to better comprehend degraded speech.
