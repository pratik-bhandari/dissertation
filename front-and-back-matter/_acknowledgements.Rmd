This dissertation is a culmination of more than four years of work that I conducted as a PhD student.
There are a number of people, events and circumstances that made it possible for me to start and finish the PhD.
Many family, friends, colleagues, and strangers have helped me arrive at this juncture of life.

I am very grateful to my supervisors Jutta Kray and Vera Demberg for taking me in.
They gave me the freedom to pursue my interests,
but knowing well when it's time to set me back on course.
All these years, they were understanding about my health and working schedule;
I couldn't ask more.
I was lucky to have two supervisors from two different departments: I got to learn from their unique perspectives in all the scientific works.
I got the best of both worlds from Psychology and Computational Linguistics.

I express my gratitude to Jutta for trusting me and encouraging me to grow and develop.
She did not let me get distracted by all the exciting topics in the field.
Perhaps, doing science requires focusing on a specific sets of questions and exploring them in depth.
I am grateful to Jutta for sharing her experiences and letting me learn from them.

I express my gratitude to Vera for guiding, inspiring, and pushing me beyond my comfort zone.
I appreciate the challenging discussions.
Vera has always been accessible.
Vera's lab has always felt like a family to me:
rigorous interdisciplinary scientific discussion, hiking, board game night, and what not!
I will miss it all.

It must be my good luck that I had some brilliant and inspiring researchers mentoring me.
I cannot thank enough Yoana Vergilova who was my mentor from the first day of my PhD.
Her feedback always propelled the pace of the development of my project.
Our conversations about different aspects of psycholinguistic and neuroscience research, and human society have had a great impact on my work.
Its imprints can be seen in the pages that follow.
Thanks also to Katja Häuser for the discussion on prediction, aging, and statistics.
Our discussions always left me with questions, the answer to which I have attempted to find and write on this dissertation.

I joined SFB around the same time as Marjolein van Os and Anupama Chingacham in the same project.
I cannot thank Marjolein enough for her academic companionship, for listening to my experiences and sharing hers: the pain and difficulties and joy we encountered along the PhD journey.
Our discussion on language comprehension, predictive processing, statistical modeling, and everything-PhD are all imprinted in this dissertation.
I extend my gratitude to Anu for always encouraging, checking in, and helping me learn about language models.

My colleagues Anna Maria Marchal, Kaveri Anuranjana, and Emilia Ellisiepan have been greatly generous with their time and resources.
I thank them.
I also thank Xudong Hong, Margarita Ryzhova, Jia Ern Loy, Frances Pikyu Yung, and Alexandra Yevgenyevna Mayn.
I am especially grateful to Marian for patiently reading through the chapters of this dissertation and pointing out errors.
(Of course, all remaining errors are my own.)
She is not just a smart academic, but also a kind and wonderful friend.

The Collaborative Research Center (SFB) was truly collaborative, not just academically but also in making a network of people with similar experiences: PhD students.
I'd like to thank Koel Dutta Chowdhary, Badr Abdullah, and Julia Meßmer.
The PhD-postdoc meetings, and virtual coffee meetups were wonderful.
I am grateful to Marie-Ann Kühne, Sabine Loskyll, Diana Steffen, and Patricia Borrull Enguix from the SFB coordination office.
Their helping hands made all the administrative works move fast.

Many people outside the immediate vicinity of my project have also contributed to this dissertation.
I am forever grateful to Saad without whom I couldn't possibly have completed this dissertation.
He has been a great friend whose moral and emotional support kept me going through the hard times.

Thanks to my friends who have listened to my rants, complaints and cries for years, and yet encouraged and inspired me to keep going.
I hope the international meetups and trips will still continue with Kirk Goodard, Trisha Thomas, and Liu Mengxing.
Despite being miles away and not having met for years, Keshav Poudel has always inspired and encouraged me to be a better human being.
I thank him for being a harsh critic and a loving friend.
Thanks to Tobias Schneider for regularly checking in on my health and research.

My gratitude goes to Magda Altmann and James Hartzell who have given me a home away from home.
They always provided a shelter of perspectives when I thought I ran out of hope.

I would not have known about scientific research in cognitive science, psychology and psycholinguistics if Lekhnath Pathak (Tribhuvan University, Nepal) had not introduced me to the field, and if Ramesh Kumar Mishra (University of Hyderabad, India) had not trained me in his lab.
I am forever indebted to them both.
Thanks also to my Masters thesis supervisor David Soto (BCBL) who introduced me to the world of predictive processing.

Thanks to the strangers who always kept me 'on the ground'.
They had simple but thought provoking questions about the big picture of scientific research.

Words fall short to express gratitude towards my family.
They have been there with me in every step of the way.
*Bhai*-*buhari* --- thanks for taking all the responsibility at home in my absence.
*Baa*-*Aamaa* --- thank you for the love and care.
Thank you for understanding my whims and my absence, for keeping me sane.
