Listening in an adverse environment poses a challenge -- it is difficult to understand what is being said when there is background noise, or when the speaker’s speech signal is distorted. Nevertheless, listeners show remarkable success in understanding the distorted speech by utilizing context information to form predictions about upcoming linguistic events. The extent to which such top-down predictions are useful is still a matter of debate. Additionally, the role of other factors such as attention and rate of flow of information in degraded speech comprehension are understudied. In this thesis, I present a broader overview of the role of semantic predictions on degraded speech comprehension across lifespan, and how it interplays with attention, and rate of flow of information.
In the first experiment (Chapter 4.1), I show that listeners can flexibly pay attention to a portion of speech stream; and attending to the sentence context is necessary to utilize the context and form top-down predictions. I show in the second experiment (Chapter 4.2) that as listeners utilize the context information, they form semantic predictions about upcoming linguistic events in a graded manner when the speech is moderately degraded. Semantic predictions are not restricted to only most highly likely sentence endings. I also argue for a novel metric to measure language comprehension, and show that sensory adaptation to degraded speech is disrupted by change in higher-level semantic features of speech.
Perception, processing and comprehension of degraded speech is difficult and effortful. In the third experiment (Chapter 4.3), I show that when the rate of flow of information is changed by increasing the speed of speech, the facilitatory effect of predictability is observed even at a mildly degraded speech. That is, earlier (in Chapter 4.2), mild degradation was easier to process; but increase in speed rendered the speech processing difficult such that predictability had a facilitatory effect. To examine the general age differences in the facilitatory effect of predictability, I conducted a fourth experiment (Chapter 4.4) where younger adults (age range 18-30) and older adults (age range = …) were recruited. Highest age difference in the use of sentence context for language comprehension was observed at the moderate level of speech degradation. This supported the hypothesis that sensory decline with aging tips older adults to rely on context information more than younger adults do. I show the neural markers of these age differences in the fifth experiment (Chapter 4.5) … … … 
Taken together, this thesis and the results herein support the views that sentence context and semantic prediction facilitate comprehension of moderately degraded speech in a graded manner, and reliance on context increases with age.
<!--Taken together, this thesis shows that when listeners attend to the sentence context, they form semantic predictions about upcoming linguistic events in a graded manner when the speech is moderately degraded across lifespan, and with an increase in rate of flow of information, such a facilitatory effect is observed even at mild degradation level.-->
