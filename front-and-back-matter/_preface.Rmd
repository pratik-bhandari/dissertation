It was never my prediction that I'd be a researcher.
And here I am, writing this thesis, compiling my research on *prediction*.
Being the first person in my family to go to the university and achieve do a PhD is quite an overwhelming feeling.
If I had to thank someone, it'd be my baa and aamai.
And bhai who took care of them while I left home at 14.

This thesis is not just the result of the 4 years of doctoral training in Saarland University.
During my undergrad in the Institute of Medicine, Lekhnath sir ignited the fire of *research* whatever it meant at that moment.
It took me to work in the lab of Ramesh sir in University of Hyderabad.
I can't thank him enough for molding my raw scientific thoughts into critical thinking and giving me the opportunity to explore all the frontires of cognitive science possible.
Who'd have predicted that a speech-language pathologist cum audiologist from Nepal would be interested in doing a PhD in predictive processing?
Thanks to David for introducing to this wonderful topic during my Masters at the BCBL.

My life has always been about reducing uncertainty.
Yet, the future has always been uncertain for me.
Will I get a job after my Bachelors?
Will I get a enrolled in a Masters program anywhere in the planet?
Can I afford?
How long till I get a PhD, if at all?

It is hard to predict what happens next in life.
Even now, I don't know what comes after PhD.
And here I am writing a thesis on prediction.

It has been a long journey.
4 years in Germany, thousands of miles away from *home*.





moving from place to place ever since I was two years old.

 Include works that didn't go in the thesis.
