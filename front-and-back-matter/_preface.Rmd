This dissertation in front of you is a collection of studies on *prediction* in language comprehension.
It took me almost four years to arrive at this point: joining the PhD program at the Saarland University, conducting experiments, finishing writing the dissertation, and all the ups and downs in between.
At the end of my Masters and in the beginning of the PhD,
I was a firm believer in prediction as the fundamental mechanism of human cognition, including language processing.

Credit goes to Karl Friston and Andy Clark among others who propagated the concept of *brain as a prediction machine* among the scientific communities across different domains of cognitive science.
However, the proposal that humans make predictions about upcoming events in linguistic and non-linguistic contexts was not new.
Helmoltz had long ago written about it in the mid 19th century.
Similarly in psycholinguistics, the discussion about the predictive nature of language processing was not new either:
People like Endel Tulving from the corners of psychology introduced the idea of prediction in language in the early 1960s.
The work of 

At present, there is little to no disagreement that language processing is generally predictive in nature.
Questions remain about the status of prediction in different communicative scenarios,
like adverse listening condition, increased listening effort, speaker variability, etc.
This thesis examines the boundary conditions of predictive language processing.
The findings show that for listeners to utilise the context information and form predictions,
they first have to allocate attention to the context.
Else, there is no contextual facilitation.
Any facilitatory effect of semantic context that is observed while listeners attend to the context is present only when the speech is moderately degraded,
i.e., when the adversity of the listening condition is moderate.
This thesis shows that slowing down the speech, by reducing the speech rate, does not increase the contextual facilitation.
But speeding by increasing the speech rate impairs prediction, especially when the context is less constraining.
The interaction of top-down and bottom-up information investigated in this thesis suggested that the prediction in language processing is not *always* present,
and it is not an automatic phenomeon.
There are limits to prediction.
After these four years, my beliefs are now updated: language comprehension is, of course, predictive in nature, but prediction might not always be present (or necessary). 

<!-- In the early 2000s, work of @DeLong2005 sparked debate on the nature of predictability. -->
<!--In the studies reported in this thesis, the interaction of top-down and bottom-up processes in language comprehension in adverse listening conditions is examined.
The results replicated prior findings that listeners use context information to form semantic predictions,
and the facilitatory effect of predictions is observed when the speech is moderately degraded.
The
Our findings also suggest that for such contextual facilitation to occur, listeners must attend to the context information.-->

Arriving at this scientific juncture would not have been possible without the help and support of a number of people, events, and circumstances.
It was educational to be affiliated with two departments, Psychology as well as Computational Linguistics:
I got the best of both worlds.
Thanks to Prof. Vera Demberg and Prof. Jutta Kray who were great supervisors.
They gave me the freedom to pursue my interests,
but knowing well when it's time to set me back on course.
In those uncertain times, during lockdown, I don't know what I'd have done without their continuous support and encouragement.
All these years, they were understanding about my health and working schedule;
I couldn't ask for better supervisors.
I am grateful to Vera for taking me in her team which has always felt like a family to me:
rigorous interdisciplinary scientific discussion, hiking, board game night, and what not!
She has at times pushed me beyond my comfort zone, where I have learned and achieved more than I'd have otherwise.
<!-- If I ever have a lab of my own in the future, I'll make sure to learn the best practice from you, Vera. -->
I express my gratitude to Jutta for trusting me and encouraging me to grow and develop.
She did not let me get distracted by all the exciting topics in the field.
Perhaps, doing science requires focusing on a specific sets of questions and exploring them in depth.
I am grateful to Jutta for letting me learn from her experience.
It must be my good luck that I had brilliant inspiring researchers mentoring me.
I cannot thank enough Dr Yoana Vergilova who was my mentor since day 1.
Your feedback always propelled the pace of the development of my project.
The conversations that we had about psycholinguistic and neuroscience research, and human society have had a great impact on my work and my thinking.
Its imprints can be seen in the pages that follow.
Thanks also to Dr. Katja HÃ¤user for the discussion on prediction, aging, and statistics.
Our discussions always left me with questions, the answer to which I have attempted to find and write on this dissertation.
I was lucky to be a part of the SFB,
specifically, to be enrolled almost at the same time as Marjolein van Os and Anupama Chingacham in the same project.
I cannot thank Marjolein enough for listening and sharing the difficulties and pain as well as joy that we encountered along the way.
This academic journey would have been impossibly difficult if it weren't for your companionship.
Our discussion on speech comprehension, predictive processing, statistical modeling are all imprinted in this thesis.
Thanks also to Anu for patiently teaching me about language modeling and large language models.

<!--
got to work closely in the same team with many brilliant inspiring researchers.

I am grateful to everyone who contributed directly/indirectly in this project.

It was never my prediction that I'd be a researcher.
And here I am, writing this thesis, compiling my research on *prediction*.
Being the first person in my family to go to the university and achieve do a PhD is quite an overwhelming feeling.
If I had to thank someone, it'd be my baa and aamai.
And bhai who took care of them while I left home at 14.

This thesis is not just the result of the 4 years of doctoral training in Saarland University.
During my undergrad in the Institute of Medicine, Lekhnath sir ignited the fire of *research* whatever it meant at that moment.
It took me to work in the lab of Ramesh sir in University of Hyderabad.
I can't thank him enough for molding my raw scientific thoughts into critical thinking and giving me the opportunity to explore all the frontires of cognitive science possible.
Who'd have predicted that a speech-language pathologist cum audiologist from Nepal would be interested in doing a PhD in predictive processing?
Thanks to David for introducing to this wonderful topic during my Masters at the BCBL.

My life has always been about reducing uncertainty.
Yet, the future has always been uncertain for me.
Will I get a job after my Bachelors?
Will I get a enrolled in a Masters program anywhere in the planet?
Can I afford?
How long till I get a PhD, if at all?

It is hard to predict what happens next in life.
Even now, I don't know what comes after PhD.
And here I am writing a thesis on prediction.

It has been a long journey.
4 years in Germany, thousands of miles away from *home*.

moving from place to place ever since I was two years old.

 Include works that didn't go in the thesis.
